# stock-price-app
Create in React and TypeScript a stock price web app using Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or any other Stock Quote provider. On your app, a user provides a stock symbol to see the price of the stock plotted on a chart. The time period shown in the chart should be customizable. Users should be able to overlay an average on the chart.
